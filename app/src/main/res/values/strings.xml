    <string name="wheat_0_1"> all crops need nutrients and it is the soil that supplies most of these nutrients Yields of crops are usually related to the nutrient content of the soil and one of the first things the farmer has to do is to make sure there are plenty of nutrients in the soil. All soils will contain nutrients but often not in the quantity needed to sustain high yields. The farmer has, therefore, to add sufficient fertilizers and manures to ensure that the soil contains sufficient nutrients for the crop that is to be grown. This applies both to arable and pasture land. Farmyard manure has been added to the soil over many centuries to replenish the nutrients taken from the soil by the crop. In recent years there has been more dependence on manufactured fertilizers as a more reliable method of maintaining high nutrient levels. Nitrogen, calcium, potassium and phosphorus are some of the main nutrients that need to be added as fertilizer.</string>
